# Flight Manager Faulty Version #4

This is the _Flight Manager_ faulty version #4 involving the search flight use case.
The fault injected is corrected through a cleaning of the state (in particular of the _BillingComponent_ state) identifying it as a  _missingStateClearance_ fault, but it could also corrected with a change of scopes configuration classifying the fault as a _wrongConformance_ fault.
The fault causes an _Unexpected Shared Component_ failure mode.

Since the fault consists in a missing of the state clearance, it can not be represented graphically on top of the ERDs.

The involved test suites are used to evaluate the fault detection capablity.
The " :heavy_check_mark: " symbol, on a coverage criterion indicates that the corresponding test suite detects the fault while each individual test case detecting the faul is marked with a checked box. Conversely, the " :x: " symbol indicates a suite unable to detect the fault.
