# Flight Manager Faulty Version #5

This is the _Flight Manager_ faulty version #5 involving the registered book flight use case.
The fault injected is of _erroneousDynamicInjection_ type causing an _Unexpected Injected Component_ failure mode and it is represented graphically in the _Enriched Robustness Diagrams_ below.

In addition the involved test suites are used to evaluate the fault detection capablity.
The " :heavy_check_mark: " symbol, on a coverage criterion indicates that the corresponding test suite detects the fault while each individual test case detecting the faul is marked with a checked box. Conversely, the " :x: " symbol indicates a suite unable to detect the fault.
