# Flight Manager Faulty Version #27

This is the _Flight Manager_ faulty version #27 involving the book flight use case.
The fault injected is of _erroneousEnclosingBoundary_ type causing a _Zombie Component_ failure mode and it is represented graphically in the _Enriched Robustness Diagrams_ below.

In addition the involved test suites are used to evaluate the fault detection capablity.
The " :heavy_check_mark: " symbol, on a coverage criterion indicates that the corresponding test suite detects the fault while each individual test case detecting the faul is marked with a checked box. Conversely, the " :x: " symbol indicates a suite unable to detect the fault.
